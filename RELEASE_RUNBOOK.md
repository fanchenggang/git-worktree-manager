# Release Runbook — Git Worktree Manager (JetBrains Marketplace)

This repo uses GitHub Actions for:
- PR / master CI checks (test + verifyPluginStructure + `buildPlugin` + Plugin Verifier)
- Uploading an installable plugin zip as a GitHub Actions artifact on every CI run
- Creating a **GitHub Release** with the install zip on every push to `master`
- Tag-based publishing to JetBrains Marketplace

## One-time setup

### GitHub Actions secrets (Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

Required for publishing:
- `INTELLIJ_PLATFORM_PUBLISHING_TOKEN`
- `PLUGIN_SIGNING_PASSWORD`

Required for CI signing (`signPlugin`):
- `PLUGIN_CERT_CHAIN_B64` (base64 of `chain.crt`)
- `PLUGIN_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` (base64 of `private.pem`)

## Installable zip after merge to master (GitHub Release)

On every push to `master` (including PR merges), the **CI** workflow:

1. Runs `./gradlew test verifyPluginStructure verifyPlugin`
2. Runs `./gradlew buildPlugin`
3. Uploads `build/distributions/*.zip` as a workflow artifact
4. Publishes GitHub Releases:
   - **Rolling:** [`master-latest`](../../releases/tag/master-latest) — always the newest master build
   - **Per merge:** `build-<short-sha>` — one release per merge commit

Download the `.zip` from the Releases page, then in the IDE:
**Settings → Plugins → ⚙️ → Install Plugin from Disk…**

This zip is unsigned (fine for local install). Marketplace releases still use the tag-based flow below.

## Standard release flow (recommended)

### 1) Bump version + change notes
Edit `build.gradle.kts`:
- Update `version = "x.y.z"`
- (Optional) Put rough bullets in `changeNotes` if you want.

✅ **Automation:** when you open a `release/vX.Y.Z` PR, GitHub Actions will auto-format `changeNotes` into a short, user-friendly "What's new" / "Fixes" section based on merged PR titles since the last tag. It commits the formatted changeNotes back to the release branch.

### 2) (Optional) Dry-run signing/build in GitHub Actions
GitHub → Actions → **Release to JetBrains Marketplace** → Run workflow:
- `publish=false`
- `channel` empty

This should run `clean buildPlugin signPlugin` and **NOT** publish.

### 3) Publish by tag
Create an annotated tag matching the Gradle version:

```bash
git pull
# example: version=1.1.0
git tag v1.1.0

git push origin v1.1.0
```

On tag push, the workflow:
- verifies tag version == Gradle version
- runs: `./gradlew clean buildPlugin signPlugin`
- runs: `./gradlew publishPlugin`

### 4) Verify publish
JetBrains Marketplace → your plugin → Versions.

## Troubleshooting

### Tag/version mismatch
If Actions fails with “Tag version does not match Gradle version”, bump `version` in `build.gradle.kts`, merge to `master`, then re-tag.

### Signing failure
Ensure:
- `PLUGIN_SIGNING_PASSWORD` secret is correct
- `PLUGIN_CERT_CHAIN_B64` and `PLUGIN_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` decode correctly

### Slow builds / huge downloads
This plugin build downloads an IntelliJ distribution. GitHub Actions caching should make subsequent runs faster.
